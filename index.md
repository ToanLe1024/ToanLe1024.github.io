## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 3:

    I enjoyed lab three as a whole because it was the first time I felt like I had a little bit of an understanding on what I was doing. During this lab we created code and used math. This was enjoyable for me because it was very different from the other labs before.

* Lab 7:

    This was my second favorite lab because in this lab we used if statements to predict times weâ€™re allowed to park, and at the time I felt most comfortable writing these. Additionally, I was able to solve the errors on my own and fix the code after our lab had ended. 

* Lab 12:

    This was my favorite lab as I liked everything about this lab. In this lab, we created images that would move and turn into a gif with a printed message. I felt like I understood everything needed and I enjoy that feeling. Also it was a very simple lab which also helps how enjoyable it was. I hope this is the start of me really understanding
